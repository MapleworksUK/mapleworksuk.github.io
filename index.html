<p>Everyone needs flexible, affordable workspace in today’s business environment. The cost of an office is often out of reach for the growing army of homeworkers and hot deskers, but people need contact with other people – clients, collaborators, mentors, etc. Companies too need low cost, light touch solutions and plenty of energetic collaboration in order to stay in the game.</p>

<p>The people behind Maple Works are Richard Sealtiel and David Randall. David and Richard wanted to provide a place for professionals to work comfortably near home in this grown-up, connected way, whilst plugging into London’s developing ecosystem of shared workspaces and accelerators.</p>
